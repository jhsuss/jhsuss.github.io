        <p>I'm a Research Data Scientist in the Advanced Analytics Division at the <a
            href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/"> Bank of England</a>, and
            Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics,
        jointly appointed at the <a href = "https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities"> International Inequalities Institute </a> and 
         <a href="https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/case/"> Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion</a>. 
          I earned my PhD from LSE in the <a href = "https://www.lse.ac.uk/PBS"> Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science</a>.

          </p>

<p> My research is primarily concerned with measuring economic inequality and understanding it implications for individuals, groups, and societies. 
 I've introduced measures of economic inequality at the <a href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3958731"> neighbourhood level </a> in the UK 
 (maps and data download <a href = "https://jhsuss.shinyapps.io/uk-local-inequality/"> here</a>). 
</p>

<p> At the Bank of England, I've applied <a href = "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/predicting-bank-distress-in-the-uk-with-machine-learning"> supervised machine learning </a> techniques to aid financial regulation, 
  and gathered digital exhaust data from multiple sources to quantify <a href = "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/gender-age-and-nationality-diversity-in-uk-banks"> board diversity </a> 
 and <a href = "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/organisational-culture-and-bank-risk" > organisational culture</a>.
