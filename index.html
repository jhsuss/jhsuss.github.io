        <p>I'm a data journalist with the <i>Financial Times</i> in London. You can find my articles <a href="https://www.ft.com/joel-suss">here</a>.</p>
         
        <p>In a former life, I was a research data scientist in the advanced analytics division at the <a
            href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/"> Bank of England</a>. I still have a toe in the academic world as
            visiting fellow at the London School of Economics,
        jointly appointed at the <a href = "https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities"> International Inequalities Institute </a> and 
         <a href="https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/case/"> Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion</a>. 
          I earned my PhD from LSE in the <a href = "https://www.lse.ac.uk/PBS"> Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science</a>.

          </p>

<p> My academic research is primarily concerned with measuring economic inequality and understanding it implications for individuals, groups, and societies. 
 I developed first-ever <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-024-03059-9">estimates of wealth inequality</a> at sub-national geographical levels in the US (with Tom Kemeny and Dylan Conor -- data download <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/192306/version/V4/view" target="_top">here</a>), and I introduced measures of economic inequality at the <a href = "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0308518X231154255"> neighbourhood level </a> in the UK 
 (maps and data download <a href = "https://jhsuss.shinyapps.io/uk-local-inequality/"> here</a>). 
</p>

<p> At the Bank of England, I applied <a href = "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/predicting-bank-distress-in-the-uk-with-machine-learning"> supervised machine learning </a> techniques to aid financial regulation, 
  and gathered digital exhaust data from multiple sources to quantify <a href = "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/gender-age-and-nationality-diversity-in-uk-banks"> board diversity </a> 
 and <a href = "https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/organisational-culture-and-bank-risk" > organisational culture</a>.
