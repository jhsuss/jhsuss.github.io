Welcome to my personal site. 

I'm a Research Data Scientist in the Advanced Analytics division at the Bank of England, and a Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics (jointly in the [International Inequalities Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/international-inequalities) and [Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion](https://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/Case/)). I earned my PhD from LSE in the [Department of Psychological and Behavioural Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/PBS).

My research is primarily concerned with measuring economic inequality and understanding it implications for individuals, groups, and societies. I've introduced measures of economic inequality at the [neighbourhood level](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3958731) in the UK using the near-universe of housing values (maps and data download [here](https://jhsuss.shinyapps.io/uk-local-inequality/)). 

At the Bank of England, I've applied [supervised machine learning](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/predicting-bank-distress-in-the-uk-with-machine-learning) techniques to aid financial regulation, and gathered digital exhaust data from multiple sources to quantify [diversity](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/gender-age-and-nationality-diversity-in-uk-banks) and [bank culture](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2021/organisational-culture-and-bank-risk).  
See my [publications page](https://jhsuss.github.io/publications/) for all my papers.
